HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: With BlueJ open, run the TextTwistPanel.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Obtain a file and read the words within the file. The user can twist the 
letters to see if new words are found. The objective of the game is to beat the timer and 
find all of the possible words. The longer length of words that you can find, the more points 
you will earn. 

Scoring:
For each letter of a word that is found within the chosen text file, 100 points are earned. 
(i.e. If a 5 letter word is found, 500 points are earned.)

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Finding words...

5. If the letters entered do not match a word from the file, it is not added to the word list 
   displayed. 
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all possible words are found. You will know all words are found when
