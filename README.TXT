PROJECT TITLE: Text Twist

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Obtain a file and read the words within the file. 
The user can twist the letters to see if new words are found. The 
objective of the game is to beat the timer and find all of the possible 
words. The longer length of words that you can find, the more points 
you will earn. Good luck!
