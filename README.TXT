PROJECT TITLE: Text Twist

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Obtain a file and read the words within the file. 
The user can twist the letters to see if new words are found. The 
objective of the game is to beat the timer and find all of the possible 
words. The longer length of words that you can find, the more points 
you will earn. Good luck!

VERSION or DATE: Spring 2019

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: With BlueJ open, run the TextTwistPanel.

AUTHORS: Ryan Holland, Julia Krasinski, Briella Sala, Matt Harrison, 
and Michael Lostritto

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Run the TextTwistPanel file from the BlueJ console. 
2. When the screen opens, pick 1, 2, or 3. This chooses one of the three text 
   files to use.
3. When the panel opens, select various letters to see if it matches a word
   from within the list. 
4. If the letters entered form a word that is found within the file, 
   it is added to the left side of the panel where the matched words are 
   displayed. 
5. If the letters entered do not match a word from the file, it 
   is not added to the word list displayed.
